<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>I am an <b><u>Electronics and Telecommunication</u></b> Undergraduate pursuing my Engineering Degree from Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute, Mumbai. With a Hacker mindset, I have keen interest in finding problems in existing solutions along with finding solutions to existing problems :) </p>

<h2>My Journey?</h2>
<p>Ever since the beginning of my engineering(Yes I ain't coding ever since my birth) I have been finding areas to explore that fascinates me. 
Right from working in the <i>Automobile society(VJTI RACING)</i> of our college to <i>Robotics (Society of Robotics And Automation, VJTI)</i> to <i>Software development</i> to <i>DATA SCIENCE</i> to <i>Blockchain</i>, I have touched upon quite a lot of technological areas. Coming this far I have realised that the field of <b>DATA SCIENCE</b> has got a lot of potential use cases. I have worked in many hackathons and competitions in machine learning/deep learning and have been thereby inspired to dig in further!<br>
<b>Hackathons</b> have indeed played a major role to expose me to the different emerging technologies and their advantages in real world. I currently work in <b><u>Centre of Excellence,VJTI(COE)</u></b> on various interesting projects in the domain of <i>DATA SCIENCE and BLOCKCHAIN.</i>
 </p>


<p>My Research Interests lies in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I am targeting problems which could be solved using Data Science. <br>
In case of any <b>queries/collaboration/opportunities</b> do reach out to me!
